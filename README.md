# credit-risk-classification

Purpose

A linear regression model was used to train the machine learning model to predict if a person would either be a healthy or high risk candidate if they were given a loan. The data looked at each candidates debt to income ratio, the size of the loan, income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and loan status. 

Results  
  * The model is totally reliable to predict a healthy loan because it has 100% precision
  * The model has 99% recall for true positives for healthy loans
  * The model has 85% precision accuracy when predicting high risk loans
  * The model has a 91% recall for true positives for high risk loans
  * The model is 99% accurate at prdicting creditworthiness of potential loan applicants.

Summary

The model is very accurate at making predictions however it is more accurate with healthy loans than it is with high risk loans. I would reccomend this model for use with the suggestion that the dataset include more high risk loans because this data included more data points for healthy loans therefore the precision of the high risk loans was impacted.
